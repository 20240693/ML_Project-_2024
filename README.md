# ML_Project_2024
The application of machine learning has transformed many industries like the insurance one. It offers efficient tools for handling tasks like predicting and analyzing claims. Our project explores machine learning in automating and enhancing decision-making processes for the New York Workers' Compensation Board (WCB) by predicting workplace injury claim types. By using historical claims data from 2020 to 2022, we focus on developing a strong multiclass classification model. 
Our main challenge was navigating the issue of having a highly imbalanced dataset. To address this, we tried using a re-sampling technique, hyperparameter tuning, and predicting a variable to include in our model. Despite achieving a decent score on our validation and our test data, none of these techniques managed to improve predicting minority classes efficiently. In addition, we wanted to provide the WCB with an app to streamline predicting claim injury type. This proved to be a time-consuming task and errors are still present in the deployment part.
Finally, our main contribution is to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in streamlining processes, like processing claim injury types for WCB. It also emphasises the need for improved techniques to handle highly imbalanced datasets and ameliorate predictions for minority claim types.
